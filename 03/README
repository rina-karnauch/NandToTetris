Submitted Files
---------------
README - This file.
a - folder 
  * Bit.hdl - 1 bit register
  * Register.hdl - 16 bit register
  * RAM8.hdl - 8-register memory
  * RAM64.hdl - 64-register memory
  * PC.hdl - 16-bit program counter
b - folder
  * RAM512.hdl - 512-register memory
  * RAM4K.hdl - 4096-register memory
  * RAM16K.hdl - 16384-register memory

Remarks
-------
* DFF is given to us as a primitive data flip flop to use for timing.
* pc is implemented with the help of a truth table shown in the file.
* RAMS are implemented recursively meaning that RAM8 is the basic RAM which
  Used 8 registers and all above rams us 8 of those, excluding RAM16K which 
  Uses only 4 RAM4K.
* registers use Bit which is a 1 bit register.

HalfAdder.hdl - sum of two bits 
FullAdder.hdl - sum of three bits
Add16.hdl - adds two 16-bit values.
Inc16.hdl - increments in by 1 bit
ALU.hdl - arithmetic logic unit of our to be computer
ShiftLeft.hdl - arithmetic left shift of a given 16 bit value
ShiftRight.hdl - arithmetic right shift of a given 16 bit value
Mul.hdl - multiplication of 2 given numbers
Or16Way.hdl - 16 way or gate


Remarks
-------
‫*‬ in the FullAdder instead of having a third half carry for the mid carries
  We use an or.
* in Add16, Inc16 we drop out the last carry- we don't need it.
* Mul is implemented with shifts left, Muxes and then we add up all results
  Just like long multiplication in decimal, than we figured out the sign
  And handled the sign situation.
* We implemented Or16Way which helped us in our files to figure out if an input
  Is a 0.

Submitted Files
---------------
README - This file.
fill - folder of fill algorithm in hack language
     * fill.asm - I/O handling, illustrates low lvl handling of screen
       And keyboard usage by filling the screen or outfilling it.
mult - folder of multiplication algorithm in hack language
     * mult.asm - the program multiplies R0 and R1 which are RAM[0] and
       RAM[1] and output the multiplication value to R2 which is RAM[2]
sort - folder of sorting an array with bubble sort
     * Sort.asm - sorting algorithm by bubble sort.
divide - folder of dividing algorithm
       * Divide.asm - dividing R13 and R14 (RAM[13] by RAM[14]) and outputting value
	 to R15(RAM[15]), with no remainder.(DIV and not MOD).

Remarks
-------
* sort it implemented with bubble sort.
* multiplying is done with adding up the R1 value R0 times to itself- naive approach.
* filling is done by checking the keyboard- if not pressed, screen coloured in all
  white(all inputs are 0 for pixels), otherwise- pressed, than -1(which are 16 (1) bits).
* divide is done by filling up powers of 2 inside our num since there is only 
  representation of powers of 2 for each number.

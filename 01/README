Remarks
-------
* The Skelton for all chips is a Nand chip, used multiple times- therefore each time we use an
  "Earlier" chip from the list, we actually use only Nands.
* in the Mux16 We decided to not use Mux itself because than we would have 15 more hands in our 
  Electrical circuit which always calculates the same value of !sel which is given to us.

Submitted Files
---------------
README - This file.
- CPU.hdl - Central Processing unit containing registeres A,M,D, 
  ALU and pc.
- Memory.hdl - memory unit from keyboard, screen and RAM16K.
- Computer.hdl - ROM32K with memory unit and CPU to represent the computer.
- ExtendAlu.hdl - ALU with shift and multiplying commands.
- CpuMul.hdl - CPU with multiplying and shifting commands.


Remarks
-------
* CPUmul implemented like cpu but using the extended ALU we created.
* Memory is created by 3 previous chips- screen, RAM16k, and screen, because
  screen and keyboard are used as if they are an internal memory unit if
  connected.
* Computer is using ROM32K which is a given to us, and also Memory, CPU which 
  we implemented by ourselves and represented the full nowadays computer
  architecture.

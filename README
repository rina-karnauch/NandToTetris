                           Nand To Tetris Projects
                           -----------------------
Here we present our mutual projects for the course of Nand To Tetris from
The Hebrew University Of Jerusalem given to us by Shimon Shocken and Noam
Nissan.
Done gradually one week after another during second year of CS degree in HUJI.
Project 9 was an optional making of a game, we decided to indeed make a
"corona game" fitting to the year of 2020, the year the course was taken.
Hope you enjoy! Rina and Eynam.
